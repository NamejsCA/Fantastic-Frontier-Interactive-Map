Roblox Coordinates to Interactive Map

Step 1:
With the Coordinate Finder Script you will have to setup the path that it needs to go for example mine will go through all the folders in Spawners to find a model called BirdSpot then stores the coordiantes in a txt.

Step 2:
I had a problem where the coordinates went 90* more than intended so.
Opening Coordinate Fixer.html and choosing the file you got from Coordinate Finder (Mine was BirdSpot_Coordinates.txt) and placing it there will rotate it to North so its accurate.

Step 3:
Editing The Map.html

You will probably want to change the image link (I used Imgur Direct link). The image will probably appear somewhat random spot. so try finding the position with

Image Slider.html
